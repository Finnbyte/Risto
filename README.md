# Risto

Risto (also known as Christopher) is a hugely work in progress Discord bot. At the moment, it has some basic moderation tools and some useful and not so useful commands.
It hangs around on my Discord server and in the future, hopefully on some public servers. It is made with [Discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) and [this extremely lovely Discordgo command router. <3](https://github.com/lus/dgc)

## TO-DO
- Databases
- Delete and mute command
- Functional and modular leave and join events
- ... anything else that comes to my mind at some point.
